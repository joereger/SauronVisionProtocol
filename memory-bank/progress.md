## What Works

As the project is in its initial stage, the following foundational elements are in place:

1. **Project Definition**:
   - Core requirements and goals established
   - High-level architecture sketched
   - Project scope defined

2. **Documentation Framework**:
   - Memory Bank documentation system implemented
   - Initial documentation created for project context

3. **Technology Decisions**:
   - Selected Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for server-side hosting
   - Chosen .NET 9 on Linux containers for server implementation
   - Selected .NET MAUI for cross-platform client development
   - Defined GitHub Actions as the CI/CD pipeline strategy
   - Designed three-panel layout for protocol visualization

## What's Left to Build

The project roadmap includes:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
   - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster provisioning
   - Azure Container Registry (ACR) setup
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow configuration
   - Network configuration for TCP/IP socket exposure

2. **Protocol Implementation**: â¬œ Not Started
   - Initial protocol implementation with single command (PALANTIR_GAZE)
   - Command handler implementation
   - Response formatter implementation
   - Protocol visualization in client application

3. **Server Component**: â¬œ Not Started
   - .NET 9 TCP/IP socket listening service
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Command processing logic
   - Logging and monitoring implementation

4. **Client Applications**: â¬œ Not Started
   - .NET MAUI project setup
   - Three-panel layout implementation (Client, Protocol, Server)
   - Protocol visualization components
   - Connection management
   - Command submission and response handling

5. **Testing Suite**: â¬œ Not Started
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
   - Load and performance testing
   - Cross-platform compatibility verification

6. **Documentation**: ðŸ”„ In Progress (Initial)
   - Setup and installation guides
   - Protocol specification
   - Azure configuration documentation
   - User manuals

## Current Status by Component

### Server Component

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Progress**: 0%

- Technology selection in progress
- Architecture design underway
- No implementation started

### Client Components

**Status**: Design Phase
**Progress**: 15%

- .NET MAUI selected as client framework
- Three-panel UI layout designed
- Protocol visualization approach defined
- Implementation not yet started

### Protocol Specification

**Status**: Conceptual Stage
**Progress**: 10%

- Sample commands conceptualized
- Formal specification not yet created

### Infrastructure

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Progress**: 15%

- Azure Kubernetes Service selected as hosting platform
- CI/CD strategy defined with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure-as-code approach planned
- Resource provisioning pending implementation

### Documentation

**Status**: Initial Setup
**Progress**: 15%

- Project structure documentation created
- Memory Bank foundation established
- Technical specifications and user guides not started

## Known Issues

As implementation has not begun, there are no technical issues yet. Key challenges identified include:

1. **TCP/IP in Serverless**: Finding the optimal Azure service for TCP/IP socket handling in a serverless model may require creative approaches or compromise.

2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensuring consistent experience across macOS and Windows clients will require careful design and testing.

3. **Protocol Extensibility**: Balancing simplicity of initial implementation with future extensibility needs.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

This section will track significant project decisions and their evolution over time.

### May 15, 2025 - Project Initialization

1. **Initial Structure Decision**:
   - Decided to organize project with clear separation between server and client components
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns and platform-specific code

2. **Documentation Approach**:
   - Implemented Memory Bank documentation system
   - Rationale: Ensures comprehensive documentation and knowledge preservation throughout the project lifecycle

3. **Server Technology Decision**:
   - Selected .NET 9 on Linux containers running in Azure Kubernetes Service
   - Rationale: Modern language features, excellent TCP/IP socket support, containerized deployment model, cloud-native capabilities

4. **Deployment Strategy Decision**:
   - Adopted GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to AKS
   - Rationale: Critical for development without all runtimes installed locally, enables consistent testing and deployment

5. **Client Framework Decision**:
   - Selected .NET MAUI for cross-platform client development
   - Rationale: Native integration with .NET ecosystem, cross-platform capabilities, modern UI framework

6. **UI Layout Decision**:
   - Designed three-panel layout (Client, Protocol, Server)
   - Rationale: Provides clear visualization of the client-server interaction and protocol data flow

7. **Implementation Strategy Decision**:
   - Focus initially on single command implementation with minimal features
   - Rationale: Simplifies debugging of deployment pipeline and infrastructure setup

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Structure Implementation** (Target: +1 week)
   - Create directory structure
   - Set up initial configuration files
   - Establish development environment

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup** (Target: +2 weeks)
   - Implement GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configure Azure connectivity
   - Set up container build and deployment process

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning** (Target: +3 weeks)
   - Create Azure Container Registry
   - Provision Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
   - Configure networking and access controls

4. **Minimal Viable Implementation** (Target: +5 weeks)
   - Implement simple TCP/IP server with PALANTIR_GAZE command
   - Develop basic .NET MAUI client with three-panel layout
   - Demonstrate end-to-end command execution and protocol visualization
