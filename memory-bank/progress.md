## Known Issues

As implementation has not begun, there are no technical issues yet. Key challenges identified include:

1. **TCP/IP in Serverless**: Finding the optimal Azure service for TCP/IP socket handling in a serverless model may require creative approaches or compromise.

2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensuring consistent experience across macOS and Windows clients will require careful design and testing.

3. **Protocol Extensibility**: Balancing simplicity of initial implementation with future extensibility needs.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

This section will track significant project decisions and their evolution over time.

### May 15, 2025 - Project Initialization

1. **Initial Structure Decision**:
   - Decided to organize project with clear separation between server and client components
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns and platform-specific code

2. **Documentation Approach**:
   - Implemented Memory Bank documentation system
   - Rationale: Ensures comprehensive documentation and knowledge preservation throughout the project lifecycle

3. **Server Technology Decision**:
   - Selected .NET 9 on Linux containers running in Azure Kubernetes Service
   - Rationale: Modern language features, excellent TCP/IP socket support, containerized deployment model, cloud-native capabilities

4. **Deployment Strategy Decision**:
   - Adopted GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to AKS
   - Rationale: Critical for development without all runtimes installed locally, enables consistent testing and deployment

5. **Client Framework Decision**:
   - Selected .NET MAUI for cross-platform client development
   - Rationale: Native integration with .NET ecosystem, cross-platform capabilities, modern UI framework

6. **UI Layout Decision**:
   - Designed three-panel layout (Client, Protocol, Server)
   - Rationale: Provides clear visualization of the client-server interaction and protocol data flow

7. **Implementation Strategy Decision**:
   - Focus initially on single command implementation with minimal features
   - Rationale: Simplifies debugging of deployment pipeline and infrastructure setup
