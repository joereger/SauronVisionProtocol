## Known Issues

Several technical challenges have been identified and addressed:

1. ‚úÖ **TCP/IP in Serverless**: Resolved by using Azure Kubernetes Service instead of serverless options for more robust TCP socket support.

2. ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform UI Framework**: Encountered significant issues with .NET MAUI on macOS Apple Silicon - resolved by switching to Avalonia UI which offers better native support.
3. ‚úÖ **Image Display in Avalonia**: Resolved issues with displaying images by switching to GIF format and using `avares://` URI scheme, ensuring `AvaloniaResource` inclusion.

4. ‚è≥ **Protocol Extensibility**: Balancing simplicity of initial implementation with future extensibility needs.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

This section tracks significant project decisions and their evolution over time.

### May 15, 2025 - Project Initialization

1. **Initial Structure Decision**:
   - Decided to organize project with clear separation between server and client components
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns and platform-specific code

2. **Documentation Approach**:
   - Implemented Memory Bank documentation system
   - Rationale: Ensures comprehensive documentation and knowledge preservation throughout the project lifecycle

3. **Server Technology Decision**:
   - Selected .NET 9 on Linux containers running in Azure Kubernetes Service
   - Rationale: Modern language features, excellent TCP/IP socket support, containerized deployment model, cloud-native capabilities

4. **Deployment Strategy Decision**:
   - Adopted GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to AKS
   - Rationale: Critical for development without all runtimes installed locally, enables consistent testing and deployment

5. **UI Layout Decision**:
   - Designed three-panel layout (Commands, Protocol Interaction, Connection Management)
   - Rationale: Provides clear visualization of the client-server interaction and protocol data flow

6. **Implementation Strategy Decision**:
   - Focus initially on single command implementation with minimal features
   - Rationale: Simplifies debugging of deployment pipeline and infrastructure setup

### May 15, 2025 - Client Framework Revision

7. **Client Framework Decision**:
   - Initial selection: .NET MAUI for cross-platform client development
   - Revised decision: Switched to Avalonia UI after encountering significant issues with MAUI on macOS (Apple Silicon)
   - Rationale for change: 
     - Avalonia offers better native support for Apple Silicon
     - Simpler development workflow without special workloads
     - More consistent cross-platform rendering via Skia
     - Direct integration with existing .NET protocol client
     - XAML-based UI similar to WPF/MAUI for familiar development

## Next Milestones

1. **Client Enhancements** (Target: +1 week)
   - Implement real TCP/IP socket client (replacing mock).
   - Add more robust error handling.
   - Add support for all defined command types.

2. **Protocol Extension** (Target: +1 week)
   - Implement additional commands beyond PALANTIR_GAZE
   - Enhance response formatting
   - Add more themed content
   - Improve error handling

3. **Monitoring Enhancement** (Target: +1 week)
   - Set up Azure Monitor dashboards
   - Configure alerts for key metrics
   - Implement logging aggregation
   - Create performance monitoring baseline

4. **End-to-End Testing** (Target: +3 weeks)
   - Test all components together
   - Verify protocol functionality
   - Document system operation
   - Implement automated testing
