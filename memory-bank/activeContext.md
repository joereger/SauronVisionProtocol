# SauronVisionProtocol (SVP) - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The SauronVisionProtocol project has advanced from infrastructure setup to a working deployed application. The current focus is on:

1. **Server Enhancement**: Extending the server component with additional commands and improved response formatting.

2. **Client Application Development**: Beginning the implementation of the .NET MAUI client application.

3. **Monitoring & Observability**: Setting up comprehensive monitoring and logging for the deployed application.

4. **Protocol Extension**: Expanding the protocol with additional commands and response types.

5. **Documentation & Knowledge Base**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation based on operational experience.

   - Create connection management component
   - Develop protocol visualization for commands and responses

2. **Protocol Extension**:
   - Implement additional commands (EYE_OF_SAURON, RING_COMMAND)
   - Enhance response formatting with more themed content
   - Add more detailed information in responses
   - Improve command parameter validation

3. **Monitoring Implementation**:
   - Configure Azure Monitor for containers
   - Set up custom metrics for protocol usage
   - Create dashboards for system health
   - Implement alerting for critical conditions

4. **Deployment Optimization**:
   - Implement scaling rules for the AKS cluster
   - Add automated testing to the CI/CD workflow
   - Set up staging environment for pre-production testing
   - Configure zero-downtime deployment strategy

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Develop load testing scripts for the server
   - Establish performance baselines
   - Identify and address bottlenecks
   - Validate scalability of the solution

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Current decisions being evaluated:

1. **AKS Monitoring and Scaling**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Configuration for monitoring and auto-scaling AKS
   - **Considerations**: Cost vs. performance, alert thresholds, scaling triggers
   - **Current Leaning**: Start with basic monitoring and manual scaling, implement auto-scaling after initial deployment

2. **Client Implementation Priority**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Which client components to prioritize in development
   - **Considerations**: Technical demonstration value, development complexity, user experience
   - **Current Leaning**: Focus first on protocol visualization panel as it demonstrates the core project concept

3. **Network Security**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Security measures for TCP/IP communication
   - **Considerations**: Authentication, encryption, network policies
   - **Current Leaning**: Start with basic security and improve iteratively

4. **Testing Environments**:
   - **Decision Needed**: How to structure testing across environments
   - **Considerations**: Development, staging, and production separation
   - **Current Leaning**: Use namespaces in AKS to separate environments

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: Clear separation between client and server code, with shared protocol definitions in a common module.

2. **Documentation First**: Defining specifications and interfaces before implementation to ensure clarity and alignment.

3. **Consistent Theming**: All components should maintain the Lord of the Rings/Sauron theme in naming, messaging, and visual elements.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Designing components with clear interfaces to allow for future extensions or replacements.

5. **Test-Driven Development**: Creating tests alongside feature implementation to ensure reliability and facilitate refactoring.

## Learnings and Project Insights

As we progress with implementation, several key learnings have emerged:

1. **Azure Resource Provider Registration**: Working with Azure services requires explicit registration of resource providers, which can be a one-time hurdle for new subscriptions but is straightforward to resolve.

2. **AKS Provisioning Time**: Creating an AKS cluster takes significant time (5-15 minutes), which needs to be factored into development and CI/CD planning.

3. **Dependency Management**: The interdependencies between Azure services (ACR, AKS) require careful planning of setup sequence and permissions.

4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear, detailed documentation with troubleshooting information is essential, especially for processes that involve multiple services and potential points of failure.

5. **CLI vs Portal**: While the Azure portal provides a visual interface, using the Azure CLI enables automation and reproducibility, which is crucial for CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Multi-service Architecture**: The SauronVisionProtocol's architecture spans multiple services (AKS, ACR, GitHub), highlighting the importance of consistent authentication and configuration across services.

7. **Kubernetes Learning Curve**: While powerful, Kubernetes has a significant learning curve; starting with a minimal configuration and building up complexity is an effective approach.

8. **Cross-platform Considerations**: Using .NET technologies provides good cross-platform capabilities but requires careful testing across environments.
