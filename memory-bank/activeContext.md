# SauronVisionProtocol (SVP) - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The SauronVisionProtocol project has advanced from initial planning to infrastructure implementation. The current focus is on:

1. **Azure Infrastructure Management**: Managing and monitoring the provisioned AKS and ACR resources.

2. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**: Setting up the automated build and deployment workflow to AKS, including service principal and secrets configuration.

3. **Server Implementation**: Preparing to deploy the .NET 9 server component to the AKS cluster.

4. **Client Application Framework**: Preparing to start development of the .NET MAUI client application.

5. **Documentation & Knowledge Base**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation based on experience gained during setup.

## Recent Changes

1. **Azure Infrastructure Completion**: 
   - Successfully registered all required Azure resource providers
   - Created Azure Resource Group (sauron-vision-protocol-rg)

   - Deployed Azure Kubernetes Service cluster (sauron-vision-protocol-aks)
   - Connected kubectl to AKS and verified node status
   - Created service principal for GitHub Actions
   - Configured GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD pipeline

2. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Added detailed resource provider registration steps
   - Included kubectl and Azure CLI installation instructions
   - Created troubleshooting section with common issues
   - Updated GitHub Actions setup instructions
   - Updated progress tracking in Memory Bank

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Established directory structure for server, client, and shared code
   - Created basic implementation files for server components
   - Defined shared protocol models

4. **Technology Stack Finalization**:
   - Confirmed .NET 9 on AKS as server platform
   - Verified Azure Kubernetes Service capability for TCP/IP services

   - Designed CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps include:

1. **Test CI/CD Pipeline**: 
   - Test deployment of the server component to AKS
   - Verify successful container deployment
   - Configure logging and monitoring

2. **Server Deployment Preparation**:
   - Finalize Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests
   - Test local Docker build of server component
   - Prepare for first deployment to AKS

3. **Client Development Initialization**:
   - Set up .NET MAUI project structure
   - Create initial UI layout with three panels
   - Develop protocol handling components

4. **Testing Strategy Implementation**:
   - Create unit tests for server component
   - Develop integration tests for protocol
   - Establish end-to-end testing framework

5. **Documentation Refinement**:
   - Update Azure setup documentation with actual experience
   - Create detailed client setup guide
   - Document deployment workflow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Current decisions being evaluated:

1. **AKS Monitoring and Scaling**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Configuration for monitoring and auto-scaling AKS
   - **Considerations**: Cost vs. performance, alert thresholds, scaling triggers
   - **Current Leaning**: Start with basic monitoring and manual scaling, implement auto-scaling after initial deployment

2. **Client Implementation Priority**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Which client components to prioritize in development
   - **Considerations**: Technical demonstration value, development complexity, user experience
   - **Current Leaning**: Focus first on protocol visualization panel as it demonstrates the core project concept

3. **Network Security**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Security measures for TCP/IP communication
   - **Considerations**: Authentication, encryption, network policies
   - **Current Leaning**: Start with basic security and improve iteratively

4. **Testing Environments**:
   - **Decision Needed**: How to structure testing across environments
   - **Considerations**: Development, staging, and production separation
   - **Current Leaning**: Use namespaces in AKS to separate environments

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: Clear separation between client and server code, with shared protocol definitions in a common module.

2. **Documentation First**: Defining specifications and interfaces before implementation to ensure clarity and alignment.

3. **Consistent Theming**: All components should maintain the Lord of the Rings/Sauron theme in naming, messaging, and visual elements.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Designing components with clear interfaces to allow for future extensions or replacements.

5. **Test-Driven Development**: Creating tests alongside feature implementation to ensure reliability and facilitate refactoring.

## Learnings and Project Insights

As we progress with implementation, several key learnings have emerged:

1. **Azure Resource Provider Registration**: Working with Azure services requires explicit registration of resource providers, which can be a one-time hurdle for new subscriptions but is straightforward to resolve.

2. **AKS Provisioning Time**: Creating an AKS cluster takes significant time (5-15 minutes), which needs to be factored into development and CI/CD planning.

3. **Dependency Management**: The interdependencies between Azure services (ACR, AKS) require careful planning of setup sequence and permissions.

4. **Documentation Importance**: Clear, detailed documentation with troubleshooting information is essential, especially for processes that involve multiple services and potential points of failure.

5. **CLI vs Portal**: While the Azure portal provides a visual interface, using the Azure CLI enables automation and reproducibility, which is crucial for CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Multi-service Architecture**: The SauronVisionProtocol's architecture spans multiple services (AKS, ACR, GitHub), highlighting the importance of consistent authentication and configuration across services.

7. **Kubernetes Learning Curve**: While powerful, Kubernetes has a significant learning curve; starting with a minimal configuration and building up complexity is an effective approach.

8. **Cross-platform Considerations**: Using .NET technologies provides good cross-platform capabilities but requires careful testing across environments.
