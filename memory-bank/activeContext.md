# SauronVisionProtocol (SVP) - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The SauronVisionProtocol project is in its initial planning and setup phase. The current focus is on:

1. **Project Structure Setup**: Establishing the foundational directory structure and documentation.

2. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**: Setting up the automated build and deployment workflow to AKS, which is critical for development without all local runtimes.

3. **.NET 9 Server Implementation**: Designing the containerized .NET 9 TCP/IP server application to run on AKS.

4. **Protocol Definition**: Defining the specifics of the SVP command structure and response format.

5. **Architecture Planning**: Finalizing the system architecture before beginning implementation.

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Initialization**: Created the project repository and established the Memory Bank documentation system.

2. **Documentation Creation**: Developed initial versions of project documentation including requirements, architecture, and technical context.

3. **Technology Selection**: Selected Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with .NET 9 on Linux containers for the server implementation.

4. **Deployment Strategy**: Defined a GitHub Actions based CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment to AKS.

## Next Steps

Immediate next steps include:

1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: 
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow files
   - Set up Docker container build process
   - Configure Azure connectivity and authentication
   - Implement deployment to AKS

2. **Client Framework Decision**:
   - Evaluate cross-platform options compatible with .NET 9 backend
   - Consider development speed vs. performance tradeoffs
   - Select framework and document decision rationale

3. **Project Structure Implementation**:
   - Establish .NET 9 project structure with Docker support
   - Set up Kubernetes manifests for deployment
   - Implement initial build and deployment configurations

4. **Protocol Specification Documentation**:
   - Define complete command set with parameters
   - Document response format specifications
   - Create protocol validation rules

5. **Azure Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Create Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   - Set up Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
   - Configure network settings for TCP/IP socket exposure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Current decisions being evaluated:

1. **Azure Infrastructure Configuration**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Optimal configuration for AKS cluster to support TCP/IP socket server
   - **Considerations**: Node size, scaling policies, network configuration, load balancing
   - **Current Leaning**: Start with minimal configuration focused on stability and cost-efficiency, then scale as needed

2. **Client Implementation Approach**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Single cross-platform codebase or native implementations for each platform?
   - **Considerations**: Development speed, UI consistency, performance, maintenance burden, compatibility with .NET backend
   - **Current Leaning**: Evaluating options that integrate well with .NET ecosystem

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Structure**:
   - **Decision Needed**: How to structure the GitHub Actions workflow for optimal efficiency
   - **Considerations**: Build speed, test coverage, environment separation, security practices
   - **Current Leaning**: Implement CI/CD pipeline early with emphasis on automation and repeatability

4. **Protocol Format**:
   - **Decision Needed**: Text-based vs. binary protocol format
   - **Considerations**: Human readability, parsing efficiency, data size
   - **Current Leaning**: Text-based for simplicity and debugging ease in this proof-of-concept stage

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: Clear separation between client and server code, with shared protocol definitions in a common module.

2. **Documentation First**: Defining specifications and interfaces before implementation to ensure clarity and alignment.

3. **Consistent Theming**: All components should maintain the Lord of the Rings/Sauron theme in naming, messaging, and visual elements.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Designing components with clear interfaces to allow for future extensions or replacements.

5. **Test-Driven Development**: Creating tests alongside feature implementation to ensure reliability and facilitate refactoring.

## Learnings and Project Insights

As the project is in its early stages, key learnings will be documented here as they emerge. Initial observations include:

1. **Development Environment Challenges**: Development on macOS without all runtimes locally installed reinforces the importance of a robust CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.

2. **Kubernetes for TCP/IP Services**: Azure Kubernetes Service provides a more suitable platform for TCP/IP socket servers compared to serverless options, due to persistent connection requirements.

3. **.NET 9 on Linux Containers**: The combination offers modern language features with efficient containerization, making it well-suited for cloud-native deployment.

4. **GitHub Actions Automation**: Early investment in CI/CD automation will pay dividends throughout the project lifecycle, especially given the development environment constraints.

5. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Early planning for cross-platform support is essential to avoid design decisions that may complicate later platform expansion.
