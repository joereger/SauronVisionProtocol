# SauronVisionProtocol (SVP) - Project Brief

## Project Overview
SauronVisionProtocol (SVP) is a proof-of-concept TCP/IP protocol inspired by Lord of the Rings and Sauron themes. It establishes a client-server communication system with a custom protocol for sending commands and receiving responses.

## Core Requirements

1. **TCP/IP Protocol**: A custom protocol implementation that allows for client-server communication.

2. **Client Applications**:
   - Support for macOS and Windows platforms
   - GUI interface with buttons and text input capabilities
   - Lord of the Rings/Sauron-themed command structure

3. **Server Component**:
   - Azure-based serverless implementation
   - TCP/IP socket listening capability
   - Command processing and response generation
   - Themed around Lord of the Rings/Sauron concepts

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized into client/macos/, client/windows/, and server/ directories
   - Clear separation of concerns between client and server components

5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive Azure setup and deployment documentation
   - Installation instructions for all supported platforms
   - Protocol specification and command reference

6. **Deployment**:
   - GitHub to Azure build/deploy workflow (future implementation)
   - Considerations for CI/CD pipeline from early development

## Technical Constraints

1. Development and testing primarily on macOS
2. Client tools must be compatible with both macOS and Windows
3. Server component to leverage Azure serverless technologies

## Success Criteria

1. Functional protocol implementation with client-server communication
2. Working client applications on supported platforms
3. Successful deployment to Azure
4. Complete documentation for setup, usage, and development
5. Themed command system functioning as expected

## Project Goals

1. Create a modern, well-structured implementation using cutting-edge technologies
2. Demonstrate best practices in protocol design and implementation
3. Establish a foundation that can be extended with additional features
4. Provide a clear example of client-server architecture
5. Ensure the project is well-documented and maintainable
